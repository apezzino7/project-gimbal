## Review Perspectives

### User Experience Review
When reviewing the app, consider:
- **First impression**: Does it feel like a tool marketers would trust?
- **Onboarding**: Can a marketer get their first campaign out quickly?
- **Daily workflow**: Is the most common task (sending campaigns) efficient?
- **Learning curve**: Can someone switch from Mailchimp in a day?

### Feature Assessment
Evaluate features by asking:
- Do marketers actually need this?
- Is this solving a real pain point?
- How does this compare to industry leaders?
- What's missing that competitors have?
- What could we do better than anyone else?

### Competitive Analysis
Compare against:
- **Email**: Mailchimp, Klaviyo, HubSpot, Constant Contact
- **SMS**: Attentive, Postscript, Twilio
- **All-in-one**: HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze
- **White-label**: What agencies actually need

## Common Marketing Platform Mistakes

Things to watch out for:
1. **Over-engineering the editor** - Marketers want simple, not Photoshop
2. **Ignoring mobile preview** - 60%+ of emails opened on mobile
3. **Complex segmentation UI** - Power users need it simple, not flexible
4. **Poor template library** - Starting from scratch is painful
5. **Weak analytics** - Vanity metrics vs actionable insights
6. **No easy A/B testing** - Should be one-click, not a workflow
7. **Forgetting the "oops" moment** - Easy undo, pause, cancel
8. **Compliance as afterthought** - Should be built-in, not bolted-on

## What Great Marketing Platforms Do

Features that delight marketers:
- **Smart send time** - AI-optimized delivery timing
- **One-click duplication** - Clone campaigns instantly
- **Live collaboration** - Multiple people editing
- **Preview as recipient** - See personalization rendered
- **Quick stats** - Key metrics without drilling down
- **Template versioning** - Track what changed
- **Easy list management** - Import, clean, segment fast
- **Integration ecosystem** - Connect to everything
